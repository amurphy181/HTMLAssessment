    <h2>TEXT</h2>
    <p><strong>Sportsball</strong> is the name of the game! People (usually men) run up and down a field and into each other.</p>
    <blockquote><p><em><strong>But</strong> why? Some feel that it's a way to wage war against your neighbors without having to kill them that moment. That's what traumatic brain injuries are for, if interested.</em></p></blockquote>
    <p><strong>Again</strong>, it's all just crazy to me.</p>
